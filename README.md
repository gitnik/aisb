YESB
====

#### YESB is Yet Another Server Browser...
* built on top of [angular.js](http://angularjs.org/)
* that has a set of unique features such as
  * repository fallback
  * flags identifying a server's country (and caching thereof)
  * reloading data when a user comes back to the site (instead of reloading every x seconds)
  * an advanced search 
  * let the user add the armagetron protocol: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/html5-custom-protocol-and-content-handlers/
  
* other things that I will add later:
  * more detailed view for a single server
  * sorting
  * sharing of searches/servers
  * clans (taken from epsys server browser)
  * the ability to parse xml and not needing a php script running in the background
  * nicer options menu -> gear icon that kind of "unfolds"
  * allow users to show empty servers
  * server grouping by EU & USA
