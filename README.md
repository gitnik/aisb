YESB
====

#### YESB is Yet Another Server Browser...
* built on top of [angular.js](http://angularjs.org/)
* that has a set of unique features such as
  * repository fallback
  * flags identifying a server's country (and caching thereof)
  * reloading data when a user comes back to the site (instead of reloading every x seconds)
  * an advanced search 
  * 
* other things that I will add later:
  * more detailed view for a single server
  * sorting
  * sharing of searches 
  * clans (taken from epsys server browser)
  * the ability to parse xml and not needing a php script running in the background
